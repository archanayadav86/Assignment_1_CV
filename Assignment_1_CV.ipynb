    "Ans-->The use of Kernels - also known as convolution matrices or masks - is invaluable to image processing. Techniques such as blurring, edge detection, and sharpening all rely on kernels - small matrices of numbers - to be applied across an image in order to process the image as a whole. Kernel is simply a 2-dimensional matrix of numbers.\n",
    "An image is just a 2-dimensional matrix of numbers, or pixels. Each pixel is represented by a number - depending upon the image format these numbers can vary: for an 8 bit RGB image each pixel has a red, green, and blue component with a value ranging from 0 to 255. A kernel works by operating on these pixel values using straightforward mathematics to construct a new image. \n",
    "As each pixel is processed, a new image emerges based upon the calculated values. The new image is highly dependent upon the kernel used "

    "Ans--> To maintain the dimension of output as in input , we use padding. Padding is a process of adding zeros to the input matrix symmetrically .Padding basically extends the area of an image in which a convolutional neural network processes. The kernel/filter which moves across the image scans each pixel and converts the image into a smaller image."

    "Stride denotes how many steps we are moving in each steps in convolution.By default it is one. Convolution with Stride 1. Stride in the context of convolutional neural networks describes the process of increasing the step size by which you slide a filter over an input image. With a stride of 2, you advance the filter by two pixels at each step."
